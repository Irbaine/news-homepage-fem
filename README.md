## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This challenge is good as a start, it is not very complex, even though it helped me to get more comfortable with Tailwind CSS and Flexboxes.


### Continued development

After this challenge I am excited to delve into more complex challenges to improve my skills and my productivity to produce more apps faster, and get more comfortable with TailwindCSS without checking the documentations everytime.
Also, getting more comfortable with forms is my next goal, that's why I am planning to start with a new [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge that requires form submission.
